# Last Epoch HUD

Updated build of [Ash's Last Epoch HUD](https://github.com/RCInet/LastEpoch_Mods) for the current game (Unity 6000.4.8) and MelonLoader 0.7.3 Open-Beta.

In a zone, press **F3** to open and close the mod menu. Escape closes it.

## Install

**Automatic: Use this repo to install the mod: https://github.com/TriSSec-Lab/LE-Hud-Installer**

Manual:

1. Install [MelonLoader 0.7.3 Open-Beta](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases). Point the installer at the game folder.
2. Start the game once, wait until the main menu, then close it.
3. From the [latest release](https://github.com/Syncingoutt/LastEpoch_Mods/releases), download `LastEpoch_Hud.zip` and `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`
4. Put `LastEpoch_Hud.dll` and `LastEpoch_Hud` directly in the game `Mods` folder.

   ```text
   <Last Epoch>\Mods\LastEpoch_Hud.dll
   <Last Epoch>\Mods\LastEpoch_Hud\Assets\lastepochmods
   ```

   The DLL stays next to the `LastEpoch_Hud` folder, not inside it.

5. Replace the downloaded `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll` in this folder:

   ```text
   <Last Epoch>\MelonLoader\Il2CppAssemblies\
   ```

## Update

1. From the [latest release](https://github.com/Syncingoutt/LastEpoch_Mods/releases), download `LastEpoch_Hud.dll`.
2. Replace it here:

   ```text
   <Last Epoch>\MelonLoader\Il2CppAssemblies\
   ```
   
3. Launch the game once and wait till menu screen then quit
4. Replace the `LastEpoch_Hud.dll` file again here:

   ```text
   <Last Epoch>\MelonLoader\Il2CppAssemblies\
   ```
   

## In case of issues

1. Delete mods, delete melonloader
2. Head here: https://melon-loader.com/ (or github) and download MelonLoader 0.7.3
3. Launch the game once
4. Head into https://github.com/Syncingoutt/LastEpoch_Mods/releases/tag/v4.4.12 and download the zip and the .dll file
5. Add the LastEpoch_Hud.dll and folder into the Mods folder
6. Replace the UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll inside MelonLoader\Il2CppAssemblies
7. Head into the game and check if it works keybind F3

In case this does not work, please contact me on Discord: sync0333 (attach a log file from MelonLoader/latest.log)

## Linux

1. Check if your LastEpoch_Hud folder looks like this:
<img width="927" height="208" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd848129-0927-47c9-b330-5fd5af2b7992" />

2. If that is the case, it got unzipped badly, simply create 2 new folders (Locales | Assets)
3. Rename the files (e.g LastEpoch_Hud\Locales\base.json -> base.json)
4. Move the new files into the respective folders:
* Locales - base.json | en.json | fr.json | ko.json | zh.json
* Assets - lastepochmods
5. Head into the game and see if it works (F3)

## Optional translations

The HUD follows the language selected in the game. Without a matching translation, it uses English fallback.

Available translations are: ```fr, ko, zh```

Start the game and select your language under Settings → Gameplay → Interface → Language. The mod HUD follows that setting.

## Build

The project references assemblies from your Last Epoch install. If the game is not in the default Steam folder:

```powershell
dotnet build .\LastEpoch_Hud\LastEpoch_Hud.csproj -c Release -p:LastEpochPath="D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Last Epoch"
```
